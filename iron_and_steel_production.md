# Iron and Steel Production

Iron making: from iron ore
Steel making: refined from produce iron

## Blast Furnace, for Iron Making
![](summary_images/blast_furnace.png)
1. Hot air is blasted at high rates
2. furnace is fed with iron ore, limestone and coke (which is coal)

## Basic Oxygen Furnace, for Steel Making
![](summary_images/basic_oxygen_furnace.png)
![](summary_images/bof_sequence.png)
1. charging of scrap
2. charging of pig iron (the output of blast furnace)
3. blowing
4. tapping the molten steel
5. pouring off the slag


## Electric Arc Furnace, for Steel Making
Higher quality at a higher cost

## Casting Process
### Casting of Ingots, discrete production

### Continuous Casting, semi-continuous

# Types of Irons and Steels
1. Steel, iron-carbon alloy with 0.02-2.1% carbon
    1. Plain Carbon Steels
        1. Low Carbon Steels <0.2% carbon
        2. Medium Carbon Steels 0.2% < carbon < 0.5%
        3. High Carbon Steels 0.5% < carbon
        - other elements are present in trace amounts
        - increased strenght, reduced ductility
        - can be heat treated to harden the steel
    2. Low Alloy Steels
        - superior mechanical properties (strenght, hardness, hot hardness, wear resistance, tougness)
        - such properties might require heat treatment
    3. Stainless Steels
        1. Austentitic Stainless, 18% Cr, 8% Ni
        2. Ferritic Stainless, 15-20% Cr, low C, No Ni
        3. Martensitic Stainless, <18% Cr, low C (higher than ferritic), No Ni
        4. Precipitation hardening stainless, 17% Cr, 7% NI, +small amounts of other alloying elements (Al, Cu, Ti, Mo)
        5. Duplex stainless, mixture of austenite and ferrite in roughly equal amounts
        - corrison resistance
            - mostly alloying element is chromium
            - nickel might be also used for increased resistance
            - high carbon content reduces corrison resistance undersirable 
        - significantly more expensive
        - high strenght and ductility
    4. Tool Steels
2. Cast Iron, iron-carbon alloy with 2.1-5% carbon  
    with 1-3% silicon (unlike steels), some types of cast iron though similar in composition vary due to processing treatments:
    1. gray cast iron
    2. ductile cast iron
    3. white cast iron
    4. malleable iront
    5. ...
    - suitable as casting metal

# Desgnation Schemes AISI
1. 4-digit scheme YYXX
    - 10XX  
        Plain Carbon steel containing 0.XX% carbon
    - YYXX  
        Low Alloy Steels
        - YY alloying elements
        - XX carbon presence
2. 3-digit scheme XYY  
    for Stainless Steels
    - X inidcate general type
    - YY indicate specific grade
4. Letter Indicator  
    for Tools Steel
    - T, M High speed tooling (machinary cutting tools)
    - H hot working tool steels (die casting, ...)
    - D cold work tool steels (dies for sheet metal, ...)
    - w water hardening tool steels
    - S shock resistant tool steels (sheetmetal punching)
    - P Mold steels (molds for plastic and rubber)
